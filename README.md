# Connect to Mango
Please make a file at root titled ".env" and make a variable called "DB_CONNECT" and set it equal to the location of your MangoDB server.

# Run
Run "npm i" to make sure all of the modules are downloaded. Then, "npm start" to run the server. It will be running on "http://localhost:5000"

# Setup for compatability w/ Frontend
Please run 'setup.py' to have your MangoDB server filled with the minimum required data to have the application work. Do note that this has to be done AFTER, the node server is running as it uses the endpoints.
