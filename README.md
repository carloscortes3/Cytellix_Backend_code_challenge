# PersonalWebapp
 Backend for Webapp code challenge

# Setup
*Please make a file at root titled ".env" and make a variable called "DB_CONNECT" and set it equal to the location of your MangoDB server.
*The application does not work without having at least one company in the "companies" collection and the roles "Admin" and "Viewer" in the roles collection. Either add them manually using the API before starting the front end, or upload the files "company.json" and "roles.json" to their respective collections. 

# Run
Run "npm i" to make sure all of the modules are downloaded. Then, "npm start" to run the server. It will be running on "http://localhost:5000"
